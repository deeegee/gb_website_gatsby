Embedded motion control systems use advanced microcontroller units (MCUs) and miniaturised motor drive electronics
to replace the traditional PC

Motion controls for robots and machines have traditionally been housed in physically huge enclosures.

Featuring powerful embedded processors and rich assortments of on-chip I/O, embedded motion controllers are changing how existing products, such as robots and manufacturing equipment, are designed. These capabilities are also making embedded motion controllers the technology of choice for a growing number of emerging applications.

A typical industrial robot control would take a couple of people to lift it
